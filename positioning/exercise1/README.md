Positioning exercise
================================

This code is meant to be changed by the student while screen sharing with a mentor. Also all questions are meant to be answered with just `position and top/bottom/left/right` CSS properties

When going through this exercise with students I ask the following questions

1.  Why are the boxes stacked this way ? Why are they not next to each other?

2.  What is one way I could put the blue box next to the red box? Can you do that? 

	Can you think of another way I could put the blue box next to the red box? Can you do it that way? What is the difference in the two ways?
	
3.  What will happen if you add `position: absolute; top: 0px` to the CSS of the black box? How would we get the black box back into the green box?

I usually have them bring up the W3Schools page (http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp) while so they can reference it for the answers. For most students going through the first two questions takes a whole half hour session. That is if I allow them them to look for answers themselves on the W3Schools page and read and reason on answers until they get it.
