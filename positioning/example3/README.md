This example was created to show the different ways to center elements on the screen.
There are a few important things to keep in mind when trying to center elements.
  1. How elements are centered depends on whether they are block or inline elements as both are centered differently.
  2. To center block elements you need to set a width for the container and then use margin-left:auto and margin-right:auto. You can also do margin: # auto;, where # is what you want the top and bottom margin to be. The important thing to remember is that the auto tells the browser to automatically determine the margin on the left and right to center the element. Auto does not work on the top or bottom though.
  3. To center inline elements you need to set text-align:center on their container.
