This example was built to show off the difference between the various position styles: static, relative, and absolute.
There are a few important things to keep in mind when using the position style.
  1. Relative positioning will leave an invisible "ghost" of itself behind.
  2. Absolute positioning is based on the first parent element with a position other than static. By default all elements have a position of static.
  3. When using relative or absolute positioning use top, right, bottom, and left styles to move them around.
