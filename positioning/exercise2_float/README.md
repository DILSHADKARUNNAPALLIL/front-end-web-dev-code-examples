Float exercise
================================

This code is meant to be changed by the student while screen sharing with a mentor. At the time of writing I have not used this exercise yet - so it (or questions) may require some fine tuning.

When going through this exercise with students you could ask questions like

1.  How would you make it so the text in the black box displays under the two red boxes? Try do it?

2.  Is the green box in the normal flow? How can you tell?

3.  What would be the use of doing something like what is done with the green and blue rectangles?
	
3.  Look at the order of the boxes at the bottom in the html. Are the boxes at the bottom in the correct order? Why do you say so?

4.  Given that there is enough room on screen, how would I line up the boxes so that they are in a grid having one color per row?
