A collection of challenges that I prepared for an off-curriculum student to teach advanced CSS selectors. The goal of each challenge is to apply "color: blue" to all text that says it should be blue, using the least amount of characters.

There are three rules that must be followed:

1. The HTML cannot be altered.
2. Only one declaration block (one set of curly braces) can be written for each challenge.
3. The comma is forbidden in selector expressions.
